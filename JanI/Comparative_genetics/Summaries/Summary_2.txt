In most common ancestor:
Duplication: paralogs
Speciation: orthologs


Why orthology is important?
Orthologs represent underlying species evolution (speciation events)
orthology is the most exact way of comparing 2+ genomes
relevant for functional inference (more likely to share function)
	Duplication: copy will be lost due to deleterious mutation / copy gets new function /each half of the copies get a function
	Speciation(orthologs): tend to have more similar function

Gene families
	Group of genes that have a common ancestor(homologs)
	Hierarchical evolutionary relationship
	There can be orth and par in a family
	Orthologous group is part of a family
	Evolbe by duplication and loss


Orthology prediction methods
	Classic (1 gene tree)(manual)
	Genome wide (programs)
		Similarity based:
		
			Best bidirectional hits: blast of A -> B then Blast of B si ->A = orthologs (only does 1<->1 relations)
			InParanoid: Bidiriectional hits -> search in own genome, keep paralogs 
				Inparalogs: Duplicated after ortholog speciation (nodes closer to B1 than B1 is to ortholog)
				Outparalogs: Duplication before ortholog speciation
			Network-based methods: Comparison from multiple species(multidirectional hits) to build network -> derive groups(clusters)
				Clusters created include Orthologs and inparalogs, each group has an implicit speciation node
		
		Phylogeny based: reconstruct evolution of a gene family, detect node types, predict orthology
			
			Tree reconciliation: Compare species and gene tree, adjust gene tree to fit species(duplications and gene loss)
				Can result in incorrect predictions when done automatic -> new method
			Species-overlap: Calulates species overlap for all nodes (all branches of a node)
				No overlap: speciation
				Overlap: duplication
			MetaPhOrs: Uses existing tree databases to infer orthology
