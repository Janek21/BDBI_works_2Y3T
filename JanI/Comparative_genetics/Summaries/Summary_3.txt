Phylogenetic tree: Branching diagram showing inferred evolutionary relations based on similarities/differences in their characteristics
	Important, as biological systems are the result of evolutionary processes, and trees represent this process
	
	External nodes: represent genes, popultions or species
	INternal nodes: ancestral info about clustered species
	Branch: Relationship between sequences
	
	Groups:
	Monophyletic: Takes all descendants from an ancestor.
	Paraphyletic: Doesen't take all descendants from ancestor
	Polyphyletic: Nodes are from 2 different common ancestors

How do we reconstruct trees: Molecular phylogenetics (DNA-based)
	Exhaustive: Make all trees, later choose
	Heuristic: Find optimal tree every time to avoid testing them all
	
	This approaches can use different methods:
		Distance-based(NJ, UPGMA): No errors -> tree can be obtained in polynomial time
		Maximum parsimony: Finds tree that implies minium nuber of changes across its branches
		Probabilistic:
			Max-lik: P of obtaining the data given a hypothesis P(D|H)
				We keep the hypothesis of greatest P, we use heuristics to find it
			Bayseisan analysis: the probability of the hypothesis being correct given the data
			
			Heterogenity rate: Different P for different sites (due to evolutionary constraints)
	
	AIC: Model selection-> estimates quality of 1 model with respect to the others (Min value is best)
		better likelihood with the least number of parameters
	
	Reconciliation algorithms: 
		Hard: resolve incongruences between gene and species trees (reduce number of dupl and losses)
		Soft: Allow incongruences below a given support value
	
	Species overlap: explained in previous

Inferring relative timing of spec and dupl:
	Molecular clock: substitutions acumulate linearly with time
		Nonsyn: Aminoacid is affected -> orthologs have this ^^
		Syn: Aminoacid is not affected
		
		Radical: Change in aminoacid charge
		Conservative: No change in aminoacid charge
	
	dN/dS(=w) can be used to compute natural selection effect on genes -> best way to look at this changes is through aln or trees
