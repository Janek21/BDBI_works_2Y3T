Gene expression: genes need to be expressed to function
Transcriptome: Collection of transcripts present in a cell/tissue/organ at a given time
	Transcription levels are regulated across time and organ/tissue/etc
	Regulation: enhancers and promoters
	Alternative splicing: alternative transcripts according to intron/exon cuts

RNA-seq: RNA->cDNA (Nanopore and PacBio can use RNA directly)

	Obtention protocol:
		Fragmentation
		RNA->cDNA
		Re-synthesize
		Adapter ligation
		Final amplification
	From all RNA we only want mRNA
		Deplete ribosomal RNA
			Very specific
		Capture mRNA using polyA+ selection
			Bacteria don't have those
	
Bioinformatics analysis:
	Assembly
		Mapping to reference genome
		De novo
	Fullpath:
		Get RNA -> LIbrary construction -> Sequencing -> QC -> Assembly (map or deNovo) -> Analysis
	
Measure expression:
	Reads that map to gene accounting for read length and total reads
	
	Count reads, each once, discard if
		no unique map
		aln overlaps with too many genes
		bad quality

Sequence count~=transcript abundance -> depends on sequence depth

Corregulated/coexpressed = functionally related -> develop network -> clusters -> Co-expression networks used to discover
	Pathways
	New interactions
	Unknown functions

Other approaches to understand functions: DNA-methylation(methyl-seq), Chip-seq, etc.
