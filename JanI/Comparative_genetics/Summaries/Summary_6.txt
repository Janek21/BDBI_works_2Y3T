Phylogenetic profiling and co-evolution

Assign comparative functions by comparing genome analysis: Phylogenetic profiles
	2 genomes: One we have known genes one we don't, but we can know unknown genes through comparison -> we compare ortholog and homolog genes

Comparison matrix
		Sp1	Sp2	Sp3		
	G1	1	0	1		Species 1 has gene 1 in common with species 3
	G2	1	1	0		Species 1 has gene 2 in common with species 2
	G3	0	1	0		

Use this comparison for distance matrix (Jaccard index, hamming distance, etc)
	Hamming: count difference (how many time 1 gene appears that the other does not)
	Mutual intersection: In how many species these genes are present together
	Jaccard: Calculates overlap (more overlap= more similarity between profiles)

Systematically present together/absent genes tend to be involved in the same biological processes

Phylogenetic use:
	
	Gene	Species   Target
	A 	P P N P P P
	B	P P N P P P
	C	P P N P P P
	X	P P N P P P Unknowun gene

	Gene X probably is in the same pathways/complexes than ABC

Complimentary profiles tend to have same biogenetic function (same function)
	1	0	1	1	0	1
	0	1	0	0	1	0


Convergence: can happen in genomes and phenomes
	Drift
	Natural selection
	Constraints

	Can be used to predict genes and pathways

	Coevolution at sequence level
		Compensatory mutation:  A-]}B
					B-]}A 
				A gets mutated into B and B into A, so nothing is lost, they are differents seqs but with the same function
				
				Can also happen to proteins
	
Parallel/convergent evolution
	Convergent substitution: A>A>G>T
				   |		T comes from A and G
				   T	   
	Parallel substitution:   A>A>A>A>T
				   |		T comes from A and A
				   T
	Divergent substitution:   A>A>C>A>T
				   |		No the same base
				   G
